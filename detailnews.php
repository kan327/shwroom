            <h6>         Huracán Tecnica was designed as a bridge between worlds to combine performance and beauty. The lines emphasize distinctive new expressions inspired by the racing DNA of the Huracán Super Trofeo EVO2. The front and rear architectures were restructured with sharper lines to improve aerodynamics, bringing about         
            stability and ease in every condition, especially on the track.
The powerful lines shape a new, unforgettable portrait of the Huracán range.
Made for the driver. The versatility that distinguishes Huracán Tecnica is also a main feature of its interior, with extensive personalization options geared toward providing the most fulfilling driving experience. Exclusive interior finishes made of top-quality materials reflect Lamborghini’s Italian design heritage and include a new dedicated trim for the sports seats.
